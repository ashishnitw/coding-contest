# Coding Contest
We want to organise hackathons every month in our company. For this we want a web application where our employees can ideate and collaborate.

Hence, build a web application which lets our employees add challenges and collaborate on them and the application should have below mentioned features:

#### Add Challenges
Allow employees to log in to the application with their 'employee id'.
Allow users to add a new challenges
A challenge will have a title, description and tags
You can maintain fixed pre-defined tags or provide database seeds for few pre-defined tags

#### Vote Challenges
Employees can upvote a challenge, except the employee who added the challenge

#### Collaborate on challenges
Employees can express interest to collaborate on a challenge
An employee should be able to see list of other employees who have expressed interest to collaborate on the challenge

#### View all challenges
Show the list of all challenges on home page
Allow users to sort challenges with votes count, creation date

#### Constraints
The backend application should expose a RESTful JSON API
You can write the backend in any object-oriented/functional programming language
You can write the frontend in any Javascript framework of your choice
To save time on UI, use any popular CSS frameworks like Bootstrap/ Materialize
Try to keep the use of external libraries/packages to a minimum
